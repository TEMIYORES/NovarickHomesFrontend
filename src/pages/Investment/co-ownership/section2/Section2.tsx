            Co-ownership also known as Shared or joint ownership has become a
            popular model, especially in urban areas where property prices are
            high. It allows multiple individuals to collectively invest in a
            property, making homeownership more accessible and affordable.
            <span>
              Co-ownership of the Ruby III Apartment refers to the joint
              ownership of 1 unit of 2-bedroom apartment by up to 10
              individuals. Each individual will own 10% stake of the Unit. Think
              of it as owning shares/stock of a company. The concept was
              designed to reduce the barrier of entry into real estate
              investment for Nigerians, and also help them share their risk.
              With as low as 5 Million Naira, an individual can own 10% stake of
              an apartment.
